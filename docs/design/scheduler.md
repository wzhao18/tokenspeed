# Scheduler: admission, retraction and recovery

The C++ scheduler (`tokenspeed-scheduler/`) decides, once per round, what each
engine does next. This document covers one axis of that: **at what granularity
KV capacity is admitted**, what happens when admission fails, and how a
retracted request comes back — per engine role.

Companion documents: `event-loop.md` (the control/data plane split that
consumes these plans), `cache-concepts.md` (the vocabulary below —
prefix granularity, cache groups, LCM blocks).

## 1. Admission is per chunk

A prompt is prefilled in chunks bounded by `max_scheduled_tokens`
(`--chunked-prefill-size`). Capacity is admitted **for the chunk being
scheduled, never for the whole prompt**: `schedulePrefill` /
`schedulePrefillFirstChunk` build one `GroupDemand` per cache group sized by
this chunk's tokens, and the coordinator either grants the pages or the
request stays put.

Two adjustments ride on top of the raw chunk size. Both are pure token
arithmetic kept out of the planner: how a chunk is cut lives in
`scheduler/operations/prefill_chunk.h` (`PrefillChunkTokens` is the one
entry both prefill paths call), what each group demands for it in
`scheduler/operations/group_demands.h`.

**Alignment.** `AlignPrefillChunk` shortens a chunk so it ends on a prefix-page
boundary (or on a promotion boundary), because a page is the unit of prefix
caching — a chunk ending mid-page would leave a partial page that can never be
matched. A chunk that *completes* the prompt is exempt: there is no next chunk
to align for.

**Reserve.** What an admission holds beyond the chunk it computes is stated
once per round (`PrefillReserve`: decode width, prompt headroom,
whether the round finishes shaping the state groups) and turned into each
group's page demand by `ReservePrefillDemands` — the only writer of
`GroupDemand::reserve_tokens`. It picks the rule by the group's retention,
never by call site:

- *Full-history* groups hold the decode slot — the chunk that
  completes the prompt reserves `decode_input_tokens`, so the first decode step
  is guaranteed a slot; intermediate chunks reserve nothing, they are not about
  to decode — raised on a decoding role's first chunk to the rest of the prompt
  plus the admission headroom (§4), so a partially prefetched request is never
  stranded.
- *Sliding-window* groups recycle slid-out pages, so the rest
  of the prompt costs them nothing: they hold only the decode slot.
  Broadcasting the headroom to them once kept a 54K-token DeepSeek-V4 prompt
  waiting on a pool that had room for it.
- *Snapshot-state* groups reserve at least one growth block on a decoding
  role's completing chunk or remote landing, and nothing on other rounds (§1.2).

### 1.1 Head-of-line: an incomplete prefill holds the queue

`holdsHeadOfLine` breaks the candidate loop after scheduling a chunk of a
prefill that is still incomplete. Nothing behind it is scheduled that round.

The reason is that per-chunk admission gives an in-progress prefill **no claim
on the capacity it still needs**. Let a newcomer take pages while a prompt is
half prefilled, and the half-prefilled one may never assemble its remaining
chunks — it holds pages, makes no progress, and eventually has to be retracted,
throwing away work already done.

The cost is one round of queue latency; the alternative risks a retraction
cycle. One full chunk already saturates the GPU, so interleaving a newcomer
into the same round buys no throughput to offset that risk.

**Holding is a property of the *incomplete*, decided at plan-build time.** A
chunk that reaches the end of its prompt moves the request to `PrefillDone`
inside the same plan build (`SchedulePrefillEvent` picks the successor state
by whether the window reaches `PrefillSize()`), so a prompt scheduled in full
never holds the line. A round can therefore carry **several prefills that
complete this round plus at most one truncated one — and the truncated one is
necessarily last**, because `holdsHeadOfLine` seals the phase the moment it
appears. With 6K of budget left and prompts of 2K / 1K / 10K waiting, the
round schedules the 2K and the 1K in full and the first 3K chunk of the 10K
prompt, then stops. The same rule makes the finishing round of a chunked
prefill cheap: its final chunk releases the line *within* the round, so the
prompts queued behind it start in that round, not the next.

**Decodes are not part of the line.** In mixed mode the decode batch is built
before the prefill phases and takes its token budget first (§3.3), so a round
is *all decodes + the completing prefills + at most one truncated prefill*.
Outside mixed mode, prefill and decode never share a round at all — decodes
get the round only when no prefill scheduled — so head-of-line only ever
orders prefills against each other, never a decode behind a prefill.

### 1.2 State checkpoints: one forward

A stateful prompt may finish off a prefix boundary. Its final state is needed
to continue decode, while the preceding aligned state is needed to publish the
last reusable prefix page. The scheduler schedules the whole final extent in
one forward, materializing both the aligned checkpoint and the final,
request-local continuation state. This applies when the remaining extent fits
the round's token budget and has no pending prefix-promotion boundary inside it.
`AlignPrefillChunk` still enforces those limits; checkpoint output alone never
creates an extra forward.

For example, after a 50,432-token cache hit with an 868-token extent and
128-token prefix granularity, the scheduler submits `[868]`. This produces an
aligned checkpoint at token 51,200 and a final state at token 51,300. With only
800 tokens of budget left, the same request instead schedules 768 tokens and
leaves 100 for a later round: ordinary chunking is still required.

Admission allocates the sparse state suffix beginning at the aligned checkpoint
when one falls inside the chunk. It includes the final state block and any
role-appropriate decode reserve atomically. Only the latest internal aligned
checkpoint is materialized, not every prefix boundary traversed by the chunk.
An aligned endpoint is itself the checkpoint; an extent crossing no boundary
needs only its final output. Only materialized aligned checkpoints are cached;
an off-boundary endpoint is never keyed as a complete prefix.

`CacheProgress::materialized_state_boundary_tokens` records the aligned
boundary produced by the admitted local prefill. Publication of the preceding
forward uses the old record before the next prefill advances it. Speculative
decode preserves the record rather than claiming every crossed token boundary.
The coordinator checks this exact boundary on admission, finish and retraction;
an aligned accepted endpoint remains publishable without an internal snapshot.
`Request::MaterializedStateBoundaryTokens()` resolves that endpoint from
accepted feedback, not the conservative admission frontier. Capacity and
retention continue to use their existing conservative token progress.

One forward means one model dispatch, not one kernel launch. The state backend
handles checkpoint outputs within it: the example's recurrent scan evaluates
768 body tokens and then the remaining 100 tokens from the body state. These
are not two scheduler requests or repeated full-model forwards. The batched
conv/state writes and scan continuation contract are described in
[Cache concepts](cache-concepts.md#snapshot-state-prefill-checkpoints); the scheduler
only supplies the full extent and block tables, not a body/tail execution plan.

An incomplete prefill holds the head of line; a completing prefill releases
it within the same plan build. The same rule applies with prefix caching
disabled and during local recovery on a decode node. Remote decode-role
admission keeps its endpoint-only landing layout.

The capacity guarantees are retention-specific:

- **History and sliding-window groups reserve decode tokens.** A decoding
  role's first chunk additionally raises full-history reserve to the remaining
  prompt plus admission headroom; sliding-window groups do not hold headroom.
- **Snapshot-state groups on decoding roles reserve growth at the admission
  that finishes shaping them** (completing chunk or remote landing):
  `ReservePrefillDemands` reserves `max(block_granularity, decode_input_tokens)`,
  at least one block beyond the endpoint for every prompt length.
  Without it an endpoint with no spare block needs a fresh **empty** parent
  per state group at its first boundary crossing. A full pool can deadlock
  when residents are retraction-exempt because their generation is covered by
  admission headroom (§4). Invariant: *no request needs an empty parent
  for its first crossing* — it already owns the block. Later crossings
  re-acquire from the shared pool and depend on the capacity bound (§1.4) and
  admission back-pressure.
  The P role and intermediate local chunks reserve no growth block (the next
  sparse re-shaping requires `AvailableTokens() == 0`).

### 1.3 Bounded replay

A sliding History group can be declared **replayable** (`CacheGroupConfig::
replay_window_tokens`, see [Cache concepts](cache-concepts.md)): it leaves
prefix caching entirely — never matched, published or streamed — and the
model regenerates its rows from **re-fed prompt tokens**. DeepSeek V4.1's SWA
rows and compressor tails are the motivating case: caching them persistently
costs more than recomputing a bounded window, and the prefix hit should
depend on the global KV alone.

The cache facts live on the `CacheCoordinator`, next to the specs they
derive from: `ReplayWindowTokens()` (`W`, the largest declared window) and
`ReplayTokens(P)` (`min(W, P)`, what a hit at `P` must re-feed). The
scheduling rules live with the other chunk-cutting rules in
`scheduler/operations/prefill_chunk.h`; the forward planner never branches on
replay — the two decisions below reach the common path only through
`PrefillChunkTokens`, the one chunk-sizing helper both prefill paths call,
which also carries the snapshot-state and promotion alignment every chunk
already went through:

- **After a prefix hit at `P`**, the first chunk re-feeds `[P − min(W, P), P)`
  ahead of its new tokens, so the queries at and after `P` find the whole
  window regenerated. This is the only place tokens are re-fed.
- **No prompt's final chunk is shorter than `W`** (`ChunkKeepingFinalWindow`):
  a chunk that would leave `0 < remainder < W` is shortened so exactly `W`
  remain. A promotion boundary (the alignment rule above) that falls inside that final window
  yields: no chunk end satisfies both rules, so the chunk passes the boundary
  and the closed group recomputes the promoted pages rather than the request
  waiting forever. The model narrows its decoder to the prompt's last window, which
  must therefore arrive in one forward — as new tokens, never by re-feeding
  what an earlier chunk of the same request already computed.

The re-fed rows are ordinary forward input — they consume the round's token
budget like any other row and `input_length` counts them — but they are not
progress: `TokenContainer::Window{begin, size, replay}` keeps `begin`/`size`
as the tokens this chunk computes (`replay` is non-zero only on a hit's first
chunk), and `MakePrefillInfo` derives the model input
`[begin − replay, begin + size)`. The runtime sees the pair
`extend_prefix_len = begin − replay` and `extend_replay_len = replay` on the
`ForwardBatch`; positions `[extend_prefix_len, extend_prefix_len +
extend_replay_len)` regenerate the replayable groups only and must not be
written into any other group, whose rows already sit in the shared cached
pages the hit claimed.

Capacity: a replayable group claims no hit pages, so at first admission its
table is empty and `CacheCoordinator::Admit` itself materializes it as a
sparse private suffix from the replay window's first token — slots below stay
null holes, exactly as absolute-slot tables require — while closed groups keep
the dense demand beyond `P` the caller stated. The FSM derives the window's
`replay` from the same coordinator (`SchedulePrefillFirstChunkEvent`), so no
event or scheduler operation carries a replay parameter. Later chunks change
nothing.

Budget: `SchedulerConfig::Validate` requires `max_scheduled_tokens ≥ W +
max(W, P)` — a hit chunk re-feeds up to `W` and must still advance: by every
new token when fewer than `W` remain, or by one prefix page when a promotion
boundary aligns it — the first chunk spends the hit window before sizing its
new tokens (and waits for a fresher budget when none is left), and in fused
mixed mode the decode batch leaves that same amount for a pending local
prefill (`MinPrefillChunkTokens`, the same reserve the mamba checkpoint page
uses). Replay is re-derived at every
admission, so a retracted request carries nothing: its readmission re-probes
and replays from the new `P`. Replayable groups cannot be combined with
snapshot-state groups, whose chunk alignment would fight the final-window rule.

Under disaggregation the P role replays exactly like the fused engine and
transfers the regenerated rows with the rest of the group's retained window.
The D role never re-feeds: a remote landing carries `replay = 0`, its
replayable groups are shaped as the peer's whole retained window — no hit page
of theirs exists to keep, so the landing starts at the window rather than at
the local hit — and `Admit` leaves such a pre-shaped demand alone. The budget
rule above therefore binds P and Fused only.

### 1.4 What bounds a single request

`MaxSingleRequestTokens` is a **startup** bound computed by binary search over
`singleRequestLcmBlocksRequired`: the largest prompt whose worst-case working
set — aligned checkpoint + final continuation state, decode reserve,
overlap-depth protection, the state growth block, and for chunked sparse local
recovery the retained input checkpoint (and, with the prefix cache on, a first
chunk's cached one) — fits the pool. It is not a live
check against currently free capacity; a prompt within the bound can still fail
admission right now and simply waits.

For an internal checkpoint followed by `tail` tokens, the forward holds
both the tail and the ordinary growth reserve: the output working set is
`1 + ceil((tail + reserve) / block_granularity)` blocks. Admission and the
capacity bound share `SnapshotStateReserveTokens` for the growth reservation.
The retained input is additional. With ordinary decode and equal prefix/state
grains, an unaligned finishing chunk can therefore need four state blocks,
not three. This also applies to local recovery on a decode node, and to
single-forward execution with prefix caching disabled. Narrower state blocks
must count the entire materialized suffix, not assume that two outputs always
occupy two adjacent slots. Tests cover small pools that must reject an oversized
request instead of accepting a request that can never produce a forward.

## 2. Retraction: when admission fails

`maybeRetractForCapacity` fires when **no prefill made progress** this round
(`PlanBuild::NoPrefillProgress()`: nothing was admitted and no resident prefill
advanced a chunk) and an admission failed for capacity. Decode steps do not
count as progress — they release no capacity, so a round of pure decode leaves
a stalled prefill exactly as stuck as an empty one.

**Retract-and-grant, in one round.** The retraction serves a specific request —
the first candidate whose admission failed for capacity
(`AdmissionFeedback::capacity_blocker`). Victims are retracted and the blocked
admission is **retried in the same plan build**, looping (retract → retry →
retract) until it fits or the victims run out. The freed capacity therefore
reaches the request it was freed for within the round; there is never a free
page waiting for whoever asks first next round, which is what previously
required a cross-round capacity barrier. Two edges of the loop:

- **The victim may BE the blocker** (a resident request blocked on its own
  next page is the preferred victim). It comes back through the readmission
  phase; the grant is redirected to the first waiting prompt instead —
  granting the pages straight back to the victim's own readmission is the
  loop the grant exists to break.
- **A grant that cannot legally join its round's batch** (a D-role recovery
  chunk beside an already-built decode batch; a fused prefill beside decodes
  outside mixed mode) still retracts one victim, and the next round's phase
  order (§3) tries the blocker before any other claim.

**The victim's pages are released — and grantable — immediately**, even though
its L2 snapshot has not been copied yet. The snapshot store is issued with
`StoreSourceGuard::kStreamOrdered`: its ticket pins only the Host destination,
and the runtime fences the **forward thread's stream** on the D2H copy's
completion ahead of everything else the plan does to those pages — that
stream carries the zeroing, fences the forwards, and gates a granted remote
prefill's RDMA trigger (see `DeviceHandle.execute` and `event-loop.md`) — so
the copy reads the old bytes whatever the scheduler does with the pages. This
is the one store that pays for its ordering on the forward's critical path,
and it has to: the pages are gone in the same round.

**Every other store pins its Device sources until the ack.** Boundary
publications of a live request and the finish-time flush are issued with
`StoreSourceGuard::kPinnedUntilAck`: the ticket holds a `CacheBlockRef` on
each source, so the block stays cached and unevictable — the admission planner
cannot take it, `ClearDeviceCache` refuses, `NumNewlyReleasableLcmBlocks` does
not count it — until `CompleteWriteBack` publishes the Host entry and drops the
pin. Nothing else needs to know the copy is in flight, so the runtime copies
on its own stream and no forward waits. A cached block is never written again
by its owner (prefix reuse already depends on that), so the pin alone makes
the copy race-free. Both guards are one path — `StartPendingStores(guard)` —
and the op carries `source_pinned` to the runtime, which branches on the guard
and never on the reason.

**Per-victim quiescence, not global.** A request whose own forward is still
out must not be retracted — its result would land on pages it no longer owns —
and one whose pages a PD transfer still pins must not be either. Both are
checked on the chosen victim; if it is not quiescent, retraction waits for it
rather than sacrificing a worse-ranked request. Two global gates remain. An
in-flight load-back: it is writing pages its readmission owns, and the victim
policy cannot see that write. And an in-flight *pinned* store: it holds Device
capacity the ack returns by itself, so retracting anyone for that capacity
would be the thrash of §4 — the blocked admission retries against the
released pins next round instead. Stream-ordered stores hold nothing and gate
nothing.

The forward-out check is a count in `fsm::ForwardResources`, incremented when
a forward is scheduled and cleared when its result lands. It lives in the
resource bundle rather than on the states that consume a *token*, because a
forward is out against the **pages**, and the bundle is what holds the pages.
Every page-holding state carries one bundle, and a transition moves it whole
to the successor state — so the count, like the pages, cannot be dropped on
the way from one state to the next.

The bundle follows one rule: **resources and progress land when an admission
succeeds; a state transition only moves them, never modifies them.** The
block tables are filled by the coordinator inside `Admit`; the cache progress
(prefix-hash chain, promotion boundary, materialized state boundary) is
advanced by the scheduler on a copy, handed to that same admission — which
publishes the newly completed pages — and written back to the request only
after it succeeds. A failed admission therefore leaves both untouched, and the
retry re-derives the same completed pages and asks for their publication
again. Committing progress before admission would record the pages as hashed
while never publishing them. The scheduling events carry nothing but the
shape of the next state (chunk size, decode reserve). An intermediate
prefill chunk produces no token but does write KV, so it reports back with an
empty `ExtendResult`: the arrival is the point, not the payload. Work this
engine does not perform — the peer's decode on a P node, the peer's prefill on
a D node — is not counted here; those are fenced by the PD transfer ack.

**Victim choice** (`chooseVictim`, shared by D and fused): an incomplete
prefill first — it has produced no output a client is reading, and its
computed chunks survive as a prefix for the retry — largest first, freeing the
most at once; then decode work by most newly releasable LCM blocks and fewest
tokens — the most capacity for the least lost work. Exempt in both tiers: a
request whose reserve already covers its whole generation
(`Request::ReserveCoversGeneration`) — retracting it frees exactly what its
readmission must take back, pure thrash.

The P role never retracts: `buildPrefillWorkerPlan` simply does not call
`maybeRetractForCapacity` (the only two call sites are the D and fused
grammars). See 3.1 for why.

## 3. Per role: explicit phases

Each role's plan builder is a sequence of **phases** over one stable
candidate order: **submission order** (`requests_` is a vector — the FIFO —
with a side index by id for lookups). It is identical on every rank because
the mirrored schedulers receive identical submission batches, so no sort is
needed for determinism, and within a phase older requests win — FIFO is the
fairness policy, not an accident of key order. There is no priority ladder:
what used to be a rank in a ladder is now the position of a phase in its
builder, readable top to bottom. A round schedules each request at most once
(`PlanBuild::Scheduled`), whatever states it moves through while the phases
run.

A pass's mutable state is split in two on a layer boundary. `PlanBuild` — the
output plan, the batch under construction, budgets, and the composition flags —
is held by the role grammars alone, and every operation enters the batch
through one gate, `pushOperation`, where budget and flag accounting live. The
per-request admission layer (`admit`, `schedulePrefill*`, `scheduleDecode`)
sees none of that: it receives only the output plan (to record fresh pages to
zero) and an `AdmissionFeedback` (`admission_failed`, `capacity_blocker`), so
it can report outcomes but never compose the batch.

### 3.1 P — prefill worker

**Phases:** completed prompts out on `plan.remote_decode` (their pages stay
pinned until the transfer finishes, so releasing them outranks feeding more
prompt work), then the shared local-prefill phases
(`scheduleLocalPrefillWork`): resident chunks, then new prompts.

**Retraction: none.** A P node's pressure valve is the transfer itself — pages
are pinned until the peer acknowledges, then released wholesale. Retracting a
prompt whose KV is mid-transfer would strand the decode side.

The PD pin is not recorded anywhere; it is a function of the FSM
(`Scheduler::pdTransferInFlight`). On this role every page-holding state is
pinned — the peer's decode reads the pages from the first scheduled chunk until
the PD ACK finishes or aborts the request. On the D role the pin is exactly
`RemotePrefilling`: the peer's prefill is writing the destination pages, and
`RemotePrefillDone` ends it by leaving that state. A fused engine never
transfers. Because the pin is the state, no event handler can forget to clear
it, and `Abort`/`Finish`/`RemotePrefillDone` release it by transitioning.

**Recovery: n/a.** The readmission path is unreachable on this role.

### 3.2 D — decode worker

**Phases:**

1. Local recovery, alone in its batch — a resident recovery chunk if one is
   mid-prompt, else the one readmission this round may start (§4).
2. The decode batch (`scheduleDecodeBatch`) — every PrefillDone first decode
   and Decoding step; decodes consume no token budget on this role.
3. At most **one** remote admission — the whole prompt at once (the peer
   prefills it), riding `plan.remote_prefill` **beside** the decode batch: it
   consumes no token budget and no batch slot, so there is nothing to defer
   for. Capped at one per round because each reserves an entire prompt's
   pages; a queue's worth in one round would drain the pool before any KV
   arrives. Head-of-line (1.1) does not apply — there is no mid-way.
4. `maybeRetractForCapacity` (§2), whose grant also rides beside the batch
   (a remote admission) or joins it (a blocked decode).

The old "one of exactly three shapes per round" grammar is gone: a decode
batch and a remote admission coexist routinely, and only a local recovery
chunk still claims a round to itself (its load-back's layerwise streaming and
the recovery prefill are batch-global machinery).

**Retraction and recovery:** victims are chosen by the shared rule in §2 —
normally decode work (resident requests are decoding prompts the peer
prefilled), with a mid-prompt local recovery chunk as the one possible
prefill-tier victim. The victim's KV is written back to L2 (best-effort) and
it enters `fsm::Retracted`; recovery re-prefills locally, loading the
snapshot back (`LoadBackBatch`). A D-role victim recovers through this
ordered path even when there is no host cache to snapshot into (from
scratch), because the role has no other way back.

### 3.3 Fused — one engine, everything local

**Phases, mixed mode** (`enable_mixed_prefill_decode`): decodes first — a
client is streaming them, and a long prefill chunk must not starve them of
token budget — then the shared local-prefill phases (readmission first, since
it holds an L2 snapshot other admissions could evict; then resident chunks;
then new prompts) spend what remains, then `maybeRetractForCapacity`. The
decode batch leaves `state_prefill_reserve` (one state-checkpoint page of
budget) untouched when a mamba prefill is pending, since that prefill cannot
advance in sub-page chunks.

**Phases, non-mixed:** the prefill phases run first and alone; decodes get
the round only when no prefill scheduled. No state reserve is needed —
scheduling order is the capacity priority.

**Retraction:** the shared victim rule (§2): incomplete prefills first, then
decode work. Whether the victim's KV is stored depends on the host cache:
with one, the retraction becomes an L2 snapshot the readmission loads back;
without one the request re-prefills from scratch
(`has_recoverable_snapshot = false`) and competes for admission like a
newcomer rather than queueing behind other readmissions.

## 4. The recovery protocol

What remains of cross-request recovery bookkeeping is **one integer** on the
scheduler (`next_retraction_epoch_`); everything else is derived from the
`fsm::Retracted` states themselves. The former `RetractionRecovery` class —
barrier, recovering-pin, priority overrides — is gone; §2's same-round grant
and the rules below absorb each of its jobs.

**Readmission order** (`nextReadmission`) is derived, not stored. Each
retraction stamps a monotonic `retraction_epoch` and a `resumes_generation`
flag onto the `fsm::Retracted` state; among this round's candidates holding a
recoverable snapshot, victims with generated output first (they resume a
generation a client is already reading), then oldest epoch. The flag is
`Request::HasGeneratedOutput()` — token count above the submitted prompt
size — rather than "was the victim decoding": a victim taken mid-RECOVERY is
Prefilling again, but its generated tokens still exist (an earlier
retraction rebased them into its prefill window), and its standing survives.
A store-less fused retraction is not in this ordering at all — it has no L2
pages to load back, so it re-prefills through the ordinary admission path
(`admitsLikeNewPrompt`). There is no queue to keep in step with the FSM: a
request that finishes or aborts while retracted simply stops qualifying,
with no bookkeeping to prune. Nor is bounded replay (§1.3) carried across a
retraction: the readmission re-probes and derives its replay window from the
new hit, and the L2 snapshot never holds a replayable group's pages.

**A readmission that does not fit, waits.** Its failed admission never
triggers retraction (it is never recorded as the capacity blocker): when the
readmission needs a victim, the two simply do not fit together, and swapping
them — a writeback, a load-back and a re-prefill per swap — is pure thrash.
The resident request keeps running and its completion frees the space. This
replaces the old `recovering_` head-of-line pin, and unlike escalation-bounded
ping-pong it makes the evict-each-other cycle structurally impossible. Nor
does a waiting readmission stall anyone else: decodes run regardless, and
only new-prompt admission is sealed behind it (a newcomer taking the pages it
waits for would starve it).

**Escalating headroom** is what keeps a request from being retracted forever.
Being retracted means the previous admission was still too optimistic, so
each retraction raises the decode headroom the next admission must secure:

```
Request::AdmissionHeadroom(safe_steps)
    = min(RemainingNewTokens(), safe_steps * (1 + retraction_count))
```

with `safe_steps = 4096` — note the `1 +`: a *fresh* admission already
prepays one window (see `schedulePrefillFirstChunk`), so for prompts with
`max_new_tokens <= 4096` the reserve covers the whole generation up front and
retraction never touches them. Capped by the generation budget the request
could ever use, so after a couple of retractions it holds enough room to run
to completion — at which point `ReserveCoversGeneration` exempts it from the
victim policy and it **cannot be retracted again**. This is a per-request
adaptive backoff: it penalises only the request whose admission proved
over-optimistic, and never makes anyone else wait.

The exemption compares the windows the admission secured against the budget
that was open **at that admission** (`Request::RemainingNewTokensAtAdmission`
— recoverable from the prefill window, because every retraction rebases and
nothing else moves it), never against the current remaining budget. Decode
spends the prepaid headroom exactly as fast as it shrinks that budget, so
judging the window against today's remainder would count spent headroom as
still held: a request that outgrew a partial reserve would look covered the
moment its remainder dipped under the window — exactly when it needs a new
page — and once every resident request looked covered, retraction would have
no victim and nothing could free that page.

## 5. Invariants a change must preserve

- Admission never grants pages for tokens beyond the chunk being scheduled,
  except the decode reserve on the completing chunk (1), the snapshot-state
  growth block banked by the admission that finishes shaping a state group
  (1.2), and the admission headroom (4) — which only full-history groups hold.
  A replayable group's private suffix starts at the replay window, which is
  inside the forward's input, not beyond it (1.3).
- A replayable group is never matched, published or streamed (1.3); its
  re-fed rows are forward input that debits the token budget but never
  advances `num_computed_tokens`; only a hit's first chunk re-feeds, and no
  final chunk is shorter than the replay window (`ChunkKeepingFinalWindow`).
- A prefill demand's reserve is decided once per group, by retention, in
  `ReservePrefillDemands` (1); no later step rewrites `reserve_tokens`, and the
  helper asserts it found none set.
- An incomplete local prefill is not overtaken (1.1). Decodes are never hostage
  to it: they consume no fresh capacity within their reserve, so they keep
  running beside a stalled prefill.
- Retraction fires only when no prefill progressed and an admission failed
  (2). The chosen victim must be quiescent — no forward of its own in flight,
  no PD transfer against its pages (§3.1) — and an in-flight load-back or an in-flight pinned
  store defers all retraction; stream-ordered stores defer nothing.
- Freed capacity is granted to the request it was freed for in the same plan
  build whenever the round's grammar admits the grant (2); the write-back →
  zero → load → forward order on the forward thread's stream is what makes
  the immediate release safe, and changing `DeviceHandle.execute`'s ordering
  breaks it.
- A store either pins its Device sources until the ack or is stream-ordered;
  never neither (2). Only `retractVictim` issues a stream-ordered store — its
  sources are granted away in the same round — and only such an op may be
  fenced ahead of the plan's page reuse by the runtime. A new store site
  chooses its guard explicitly (`StartPendingStores` has no default).
- Only computed tokens are published as a prefix — `retractVictim` reads the
  window of an incomplete prefill rather than its whole token count.
- At most one readmission is in progress per role, by phase construction; a
  readmission that fails admission waits and never triggers retraction (4).
- A request whose admission prepaid the generation budget open at that
  admission is never a victim (2); with the fresh-admission prepay this bounds
  retraction to requests whose `max_new_tokens` exceeds one safe-step window
  (or is undeclared). Spending a partial reserve never makes it qualify: the
  exemption is judged against the budget open at admission, not the current
  remainder (4).
