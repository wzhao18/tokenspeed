"""DeepSeek V4.1 FlatKV geometry; independent of V4's FP8/RoPE layout.

A slot is page * rows_per_page + row, relative to one owner's field view.
All readers must use tensor strides: fields share one physical LCM plane,
not one contiguous allocation per owner. Packed rows contain values followed
by scales (SWA: E4M3/E8M0, global: E2M1/E4M3, index: E2M1/E8M0).
